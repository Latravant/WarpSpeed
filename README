Warpspeed
Written by eLii for Latravant of Ragnarok

I wanted an addon that would cast warp 2 on all of my multiboxing characters so if i had to go afk because of a RL event, 
I could just type in the command and the addon would take care of the rest, without me coming back to half my party dead in 
the world, the other half still alive in the city because my warp macro didn't execute properly for whatever reason. Plus, I
have like 23 characters across 6 accounts so there may be alot of characters that can cast warp 2, but their cast/recast timers
are all over the place and my send commands were screwing up even worse than the macro's were. So I started to write a addon
for the first time using snippets from other peoples addons and suggestions from google. When I went to the Windower team for 
help, they instantly knew where I got my original help from, without me saying. "This looks like Chrome coding." So I asked for 
some help, and a few people responded, but unfortunately, almost all of it made zero sense to me. So I decided to just stick with 
one of the people who responded, eLii, who was very patient with me and explained things in a way I could understand. But I still 
fucked up. So 90% of this code is eLii's work, I just told him what I wanted it to do, and he made it happen. So all credit goes to
him. I'd say about 5% of the code is mine, the other 5% is from the bot on VSCode that suggests code completions.

I hope it helps other multiboxers out there who may find it, and want a simple way to cast warp 2 on all their characters.
